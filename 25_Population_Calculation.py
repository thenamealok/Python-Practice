# The current population of a town is 10000. The population of the town is increasing at the rate of 10% per year. 
# You have to write a program to find out the population at the end of each of the last 10 years. 
# For eg current population is 10000 so the output should be like this:
# 10th year - 10000
# 9th year - 9000
# 8th year - 8100 and so on


population = int(input("enter the current population: "))
years = 10
for year in range(years, 0, -1):
    print(f"{year}th year - {int(population)}")
    population = population*0.9
